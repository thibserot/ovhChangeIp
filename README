Script that will automatically update your IP on OVH
To use it, first run config-ovh.py
You will need to add an OVH account (choice 1)
If you want to be notified when the update happened or of any troubles,
you need to configure your email settings (choice 5) (Works only with a gmail account so far)

The script will automatically update for every subdomains the A field with your new ip address.
The script is still in beta test, so if you find any bugs please report them.

Enjoy
